You're welcome to contribute to the project! There are several aspects you can help on:

  - improving our documentation (see [README.md][README.md] and [doc folder][doc]),
  - testing code, testing releases
  - participate on the mailing lists
  - improving our UIs
  - coding (fix open issues or implement new features)

Our main source code repository is hosted on Github: [https://github.com/greenaddress/abcore/][doc]

Any help is appreciated!

Feel free to report [issues][issues] and open [pull requests][pulls].
